# General principles
## Content types and status codes

The microservice provides a set of public `REST` endpoints, using a standard naming convention, a common authentication mechanism and follows the standard `REST` principles. As ageneral, the service accepts and returns a `JSON` document. In case of error the service returns a `400` status code and the returned documents contains a field `error` with a brief summary of the problem and a field `message` with the long description. Otherwise, returns a `200` status code, and a `JSON` document with requested information. If no information is requested, the `JSON` doc contains at least the standard `200` status code. Other status codes should respect the convention specified for the`HTTP` protocol.

A request to the microservice will always returns a `JSON` document, accepts `JSON` as well for data input, and requires a `content-type`header parameter set to `application/json`. No content negotiation is currently available. The methods described by this documentation are only accessible to any authenticated microservice user. The default authentication method is described on the sections bellow.

## Naming conventions

The `REST` URLs take the general form:

  ```
  http://$address/api/v1/$serviceFamily/$endpoint?{queryParams}
  ```

URLs always start with `/api/v1` and the service family name, followed by a required sub-service and several optional query parameters. Case should never affect the return code of the services here described (case-insensitive).

## Service families

The following service families available :

  1. __debug__: Gives access to system technical information and system healthy as well __(not fully implemented yet)__.

  2. __open__: Performs operations to manipulate the customs leaderboards for the Reebok Crossfit Open 2018.

The methods that belongs to the `debug` family are made only for developers (internal use) and the all other services should be available for service clients.
